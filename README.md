## Mansi Saxena
#### NLP Researcher | Environmentalist | Gym-Rat | Coffee-Enthusiast | Cat-Lover 

I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at North Carolina State University with a love for all things data, AI, and NLP! My research revolves around making sense of text—from understanding societal views, trauma narratives and ethical behavior to emotions and empathy (because, hey, machines should get feelings too, right?).

💡 What I do: I dig deep into information extraction, using machine learning to uncover insights hidden in text. Basically, if it involves cool data-driven discoveries, count me in!

🔍 Why I'm here: I'm always exploring new ways to push AI and ML forward—whether that's through research, coding, or tinkering with the latest tech trends. I love bridging the gap between theory and real-world impact.
